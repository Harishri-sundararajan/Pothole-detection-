# Pothole-detection-
No one likes potholes! The very idea of our project is to get them away from your way.

The first module - prediction is done here using ML.
Data collection
Data preprocessing
Training and testing
Predicting for new data

Hardware module 
Using the ultrasonic senor and Arduino UNO, pothole will be detected
For simple demonstration - components used are arduino UNO, Piezo buzzer, Ultrasonic sensor, breadboard and jump wires.
